My partner and I had the pleasure of dealing with Tim and Nathan for over six weeks during our acquisition of Evolutionary Tutors. We were particularly impressed by Tim's transparency and attention to detail throughout the entire transaction and, in particular, the handover process. His responses to our queries were always timely, detailed and well-considered."
